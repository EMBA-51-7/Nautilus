## Project Goal

Research on useful primitives to build a decentralized data economy for the common goods.

Ocean strives to be a protocol for permissionless, self-sustaining networks that performs a useful data utility.

### Permissionless Network

> **High resistance against attacks**

The actors in a public network can be benign, byzantine or sybil entities. The network must be able to function provably correct under a certain threshold of polynomial attacking power.


### Self-sustaining

> **Functions in absence of it's creators**

Incentives rezard good behavior. Such rewards can be claimed as a token by proving that work has been done. 

Work is a physical cost such as energy, infrastructure and operations.

Proofs of that work need to be unforgeable and publicly verifiable  

### utility

> **Data interrogation that is secure, consistent and immutable**

# Analysis-Enigma-Integrity


```
name: investigate Enigma and potential integration
type: research
status: initial draft
editor: Ocean Protocol Team

```

## 1. Objective

This PoC tries to explore Enigma [1][2], Intel SGX [3] and other privacy-preserving computing platforms in order to achieve computational integrity in Ocean Protocol. 

The key problem is how to perform computationally intensive computing on data without revealing the private raw data. In particular, Ocean Protocol emphasizes on AI algorithm and private user data in data marketplace. 


## 2. Investigation 

Each folder contains the investigation report for specifc topic, such as Enigma, Intel SGX and others. Please access the report document following the links in each record within the table below:

Folder | description | document |
---| ---| ---|
Enigma-Integration-analysis | study of Enigma and Potential Integration | [readme](Enigma-Integration-analysis/README.md)
